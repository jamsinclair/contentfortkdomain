              <ul>
                <li>Cactus is the singular word for the  plant, cacti or cactuses are the plural forms.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>Cacti are native to the Americas, ranging from Patagonia in South  America through to areas of western <a href="http://www.sciencekids.co.nz/sciencefacts/countries/canada.html">Canada</a>. One species, Rhipsalis  baccifera, is the exception, it is also found in tropical Africa, <a href="http://www.sciencekids.co.nz/sciencefacts/countries/madagascar.html">Madagascar</a> and Sri Lanka. It is thought that  droppings from migratory <a href="http://www.sciencekids.co.nz/sciencefacts/animals/bird.html">birds</a> dispersed the Rhipsalis seed in these other  lands. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>The cactus generally lives in dry  places prone to drought, such as <a href="http://www.sciencekids.co.nz/sciencefacts/earth/desert.html">deserts</a>.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>There are 1,500 to 1,800 species of  cacti. Each species for the most part fall into one of two core cacti  categories, these being opuntias or cactoids.              </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>Cacti come in all shapes and sizes  from round and short through to thin and tall. The smallest grow just a few  centimeters high and about 1 cm (0.4 in) across. The tallest cactus can reach  heights close to 20m (66ft) and up to 1 meter thick.              </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>The ancient Aztec's of South America often depicted cacti in many of their sculptures  and drawings. While <a href="http://www.sciencekids.co.nz/sciencefacts/countries/mexico.html">Mexico's</a> national coat of arms shows an <a href="http://www.sciencekids.co.nz/sciencefacts/animals/eagle.html">eagle</a>, a <a href="http://www.sciencekids.co.nz/sciencefacts/animals/snake.html">snake</a>, and a cactus.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>Cacti show many 'adaptations' to  conserve water during long dry periods. An adaptation is a trait in a living  organism that helps it to survive, populate and evolve.              </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>The spines (thorns, stickers) of a  cactus are highly modified versions of plant leaves, there are very few cacti  species with true plant leaves. These sharp spines and the thick tough skin of  the stem help to protect the cactus from animals who would otherwise have easy  access to the liquid inside.              </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>The cactus manages to collect its  <a href="http://www.sciencekids.co.nz/sciencefacts/water.html">water</a> using its quite large root system. Small thin roots grow near the surface  of the soil and collect as much rainwater as quickly as possible during the few  times it rains. Cacti can also have a single long thick root called a taproot  which grows much deeper to reach underground water supplies when the top soil  is dry.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>Cacti can gather and hold a lot of  water in their stems. The water is not pure, clear water but is quite a thick  viscous liquid. It is drinkable though and has been known to save many peoples  lives in the desert.              </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>In the early 1800s when cacti were  first taken back to Europe they were  cultivated as ornamental plants. Rare species were often sold to collectors for  very high prices. Today cacti continue to be grown as houseplants as they are  pretty easy to grow and maintain. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li>Certain kinds of cactus have fruit  that are a popular source of food. The dragon fruit (pitahaya) is now widely  grown in Asia. The prickly pear or Indian fig  are varieties of cacti whereby both the fruit (called tuna in Spanish) and the pads  (called nopal in Spanish) can be eaten. The nopal industry in Mexico was worth around US$150 million in 2007  and the fruit (nopal) is an important commercial crop in Mediterranean  and North African countries.              </li>
              </ul>
